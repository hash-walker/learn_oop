Bringing It Together in the Dragon Class
Let's bring all we've done together in the Dragon class. The Dragon class should override the Unit class's in_area method. Instead of checking if the center position of the Dragon is in the given area, we'll check if its big dragon body overlaps with the given area.

Methods in parent classes often use pass to signal they should be overridden in child classes. To override, create a method with the same name in the child class.

Assignment
First, complete the Dragon's constructor. The dragon needs one more private data member: __hit_box. The hitbox is a Rectangle object. You've been provided with the height, width, and center position (pos_x, pos_y) of the dragon.

Example Hitbox
hitbox

in_area() method()
Next, you'll need to override the in_area method that the Dragon class inherited from the Unit class. In the Dragon class' in_area method, create a new rectangle object with the given corner positions, and use the rectangle's overlaps method to check if the Dragon's self.__hit_box is inside it. This method should return a boolean value.

Tips
Add half of the width to pos_x to find the right side.
Subtract half of the width from pos_x to find the left side.
Add half of the height to pos_y to find the top side.
Subtract half of the height from pos_y to find the bottom side.
