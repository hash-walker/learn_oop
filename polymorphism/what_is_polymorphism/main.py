What Is Polymorphism?
While inheritance is the most unique trait of object-oriented languages, polymorphism is probably the most powerful. Polymorphism is the ability of a variable, function or object to take on multiple forms.

"poly"="many"
"morph"="form".
For example, classes in the same hierarchical tree may have methods with the same name but different behaviors.

Different Forms
Let's look at a simple example.

class Creature():
    def move(self):
        print("the creature moves")

class Dragon(Creature):
    def move(self):
        print("the dragon flies")

class Kraken(Creature):
    def move(self):
        print("the kraken swims")

for creature in [Creature(), Dragon(), Kraken()]:
    creature.move()
# prints:
# the creature moves
# the dragon flies
# the kraken swims
Copy icon
The Dragon and Kraken child classes are overriding the behavior of their parent class's move() method.

Assignment
We're going to build hit-box logic for our game step by step, starting with a simple Rectangle.

Complete the __init__() method. Configure the class to have properties matching the variables passed into the constructor in this order:

x1
y1
x2
y2
"""

class Rectangle:
    def __init__(self, x1, y1, x2, y2):
        self.x1 = x1
        self.y1 = y1
        self.x2 = x2
        self.y2 = y2
