Multiple Objects
An object is an "instance" of a class. Let's look at what that means.

In object-oriented programming, an instance is a concrete occurrence of any object... "Instance" is synonymous with "object" as they are each a particular value... "Instance" emphasizes the distinct identity of the object. The creation of an instance is called instantiation.

-- Wikipedia

So for our wall class, I can create three different "instances" of the class. Or, in other words, I can create three separate objects.

wall_maria = Wall(1, 2, 3)
wall_rose = Wall(4, 5, 6)
wall_sina = Wall(9, 8, 7)

In the example above, the variables are instances of the Wall type.

Assignment
Take a look at the Brawler class and the fight function provided.

In the main function:

Create 4 new brawlers with the following stats:
Name: Aragorn. Speed: 4. Strength: 4.
Name: Gimli. Speed: 2. Strength: 7.
Name: Legolas. Speed: 7. Strength: 7.
Name: Frodo. Speed: 3. Strength: 2.
Call fight twice.
The first fight should be Aragorn vs Gimli.
The second will be Legolas vs Frodo.
