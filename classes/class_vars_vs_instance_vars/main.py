Class Variables vs. Instance Variables
So far we've worked with both class variables and instance variables, but we haven't talked about the difference.

Instance Variables
Instance variables vary from object to object and are declared in the constructor.

class Wall:
    def __init__(self):
        self.height = 10

south_wall = Wall()
south_wall.height = 20 # only updates this instance of a wall
print(south_wall.height)
# prints "20"

north_wall = Wall()
print(north_wall.height)
# prints "10"

Class Variables
Class variables remain the same between instances of the same class and are declared at the top level of a class definition.

class Wall:
    height = 10

south_wall = Wall()
print(south_wall.height)
# prints "10"

Wall.height = 20 # updates all instances of a Wall

print(south_wall.height)
# prints "20"

In other languages these types of variables are often called static variables.

Variables, Fields and Properties
The terms instance and class variable, field, property and attribute are used interchangeably and usually refer to the same concept in languages that support some form of object-oriented programming. Here's a quick reference for some popular languages:

Language	Class variable	Instance variable
Python	Class variable	Instance variable
Go	Field	Field
JavaScript	Property	Property
C#	Static field	Field
Java	Static field	Field
Which Should I Use?
Generally speaking, stay away from class variables. Just like global variables, class variables are usually a bad idea because they make it hard to keep track of which parts of your program are making updates. However, it is important to understand how they work because you may see them out in the wild.

Assignment
Some lazy code that's managed by another development team is causing some bugs in our team's class. We can fix it by using instance variables instead of class variables.

In the main() function (that our team isn't responsible for), a line like Dragon.element = "fire" should not affect our existing dragon instances! We want our users to specify each dragon's element type when they create a new dragon with the constructor.

Update the Dragon class. Remove the element class variable and instead use an instance variable that's configurable via the constructor.

class Dragon:
    

    def __init__(self, element):
        self.element = element

    def get_breath_damage(self):
        if self.element == "fire":
            return 300
        if self.element == "ice":
            return 150
        return 0

def main():
    first_dragon = Dragon("fire")
    print(
        f"{first_dragon.element} dragon does {first_dragon.get_breath_damage()} damage"
    )

    second_dragon = Dragon("ice")
    Dragon.element = "fire"
    print(
        f"{second_dragon.element} dragon does {second_dragon.get_breath_damage()} damage"
    )


main()
