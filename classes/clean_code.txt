Clean Code
Paradigms like object-oriented programming and functional programming are all about making code easier to work with and understand as the feeble humans we are. Code that's easy for humans to understand is called "clean code".

Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.

-- Martin Fowler

Clean Code Does Not
Make your programs run faster
Make your programs function correctly
Only occur in object-oriented programming
Clean Code Does
Make code easier to work with
Make it easier to find and fix bugs
Make the development process faster
Help us retain our sanity
