Dragons
We've created a lot of classes in this course, now let's write some code that uses them.

Assignment
Let's have ourselves a little dragon fight. Complete the bottom half of the main() function using two for-loops.

In the first for-loop, describe() all of the dragons, starting with the first dragon in the list and ending with the last dragon in the list.
In the next for-loop, have each dragon breathe_fire at coordinate x=3, y=3. Pass in all of the other dragons (not the one breathing fire) as the units parameter so we can see if they get hit.
Pass in the dragons in ascending index order. For example, when Blue Dragon breathes fire, it should breathe fire on the other dragons in this order:

Green Dragon
Red Dragon
Black Dragon
Example Output
Once you describe the dragons, your output should look like this:

Green Dragon is at 0/0
Red Dragon is at 2/2
Blue Dragon is at 4/3
Black Dragon is at 5/-1
Copy icon
The output of the first dragon breathing fire should look like this:

Green Dragon breathes fire at 3/3 with range 1
====================================
Red Dragon is hit by the fire
Blue Dragon is hit by the fire
Red Dragon breathes fire at 3/3 with range 2
Copy icon
Tips
Copying a List
To get a new copy of a list, use the copy() method. If you don't, your new variable will just be a reference to the original list.

nums = [4, 3, 2, 1]
nums_copy = nums.copy()
# nums_copy is [4, 3, 2, 1]
Copy icon
Delete from a List
nums = [4, 3, 2, 1]
del nums[1]
# nums is [4, 2, 1]
