Dragons
In "Age of Dragons", there are Orcs, Humans, Goblins, Dragons, etc. All of those different creatures are called "units". At the moment, the only thing specific to a unit is that it has a position on the game map and a name.

Dragons, a specific type of unit, can breathe fire in a large area dealing damage to any units that are touched by its fiery blaze.

The Game Grid
Our game map is just a Cartesian plane.

Assignment
Complete the unit's in_area method and the dragon's breathe_fire method.

in_area
This method has four parameters, x_1, y_1, x_2, and y_2. The coordinates x_1 and y_1 represent the bottom-left corner of the rectangle, while x_2 and y_2 represent the top-right corner.

To determine if a unit is within or on the boundary of this rectangle, use the unit's position coordinates pos_x and pos_y. If the unit's position falls inside or on the edge of the rectangle, the method returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

breathe_fire
This method causes the dragon to breathe a swath of fire in the target area. The target area is centered at (x,y). The area stretches for __fire_range in both directions inclusively.

For each unit in the units list, append that unit to a list if the unit is within the blast. Return the list of units hit by the blast.

Example of Fire Breath Hitting a Unit

The example above uses a __fire_range of 1 centered at (1, 1).
