Inheritance Hierarchy
There is no limit to how deeply we can nest an inheritance tree. For example, a Cat can inherit from an Animal that inherits from LivingThing. That said, be careful! New programmers often get carried away.

You should never think to yourself:

"Well most wizards are elves... so I'll just have wizard inherit from elf"

A good child class is a strict subset of its parent class.

An example of this with private properties. A child class cannot simply access a private property of its parent class. It has to use a getter. For example:

class Wall:
    def __init__(self, height):
        self.__height = height

    def get_height(self):
        return self.__height

class Castle(Wall):
    def __init__(self, height, towers):
        super().__init__(height)
        self.towers = towers

    def get_tower_height(self):
        return self.get_height() * 2

Assignment
Let's add a new game unit: Crossbowman. A crossbowman is always an archer, but not all archers are crossbowmen. Crossbowmen have several arrows, but they have an additional method: triple_shot().

Add a use_arrows(self, num) method to the Archer class. It should remove num arrows. If there aren't enough arrows to remove, it should raise a not enough arrows exception.
The Crossbowman class's constructor should call its parent's constructor.
The crossbowman's triple_shot method should use 3 arrows.
The crossbowman's triple_shot method takes a target as a parameter and returns {} was shot by 3 crossbow bolts where {} is the name of the Human that was shot.
