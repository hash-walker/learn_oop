Multiple Children
So far we've worked with linear class inheritance, but usually, inheritance hierarchies form trees, not lines. A parent class can have multiple children.

inheritance tree

Assignment
The Archer class should inherit from Hero. Ensure the following requirements from the game designers are completed:

Archer should inherit from Hero
Archer should set up the hero's name and health
Set a private "number of arrows" variable that can be passed in as a third parameter to the constructor.
Create a shoot method that takes a target hero as input. If there are no arrows left, raise a not enough arrows exception. Otherwise, remove an arrow and deal 10 damage to the target hero.
