When Should I Use Inheritance?
Inheritance is a powerful tool, but it is a really bad idea to try to overuse it. Inheritance should only be used when all instances of a child class are also instances of the parent class.

When a child class inherits from a parent, it inherits everything. If you only want to share some functionality, inheritance is probably not the best answer. Better to simply share some functions, or maybe make a new parent class that both classes can inherit from.
