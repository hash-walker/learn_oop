Not Security
Encapsulation is the practice of hiding code complexity inside a "black box" so that other developers working with the code don't have to worry about it.

To be clear, it does not make the code more secure in a cryptographic or cyber-security sense. That's a point I was personally confused about when I was first learning about private and public class members.

Encapsulation is about organization, not security.

Encapsulation is like folders in an unlocked filing cabinet. They don't stop someone from peeking inside, but they do keep everything tidy and easy to find.
